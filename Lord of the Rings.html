<h1>Welcome to my Lord of the Rings page</h1>

<p>One of my interests besides my family is Lord of the Rings. Some of my favorite movie series is the Lord of the Rings Series. I am in the middle of reading the actually books. They are really good. I have the extended versions of the movies and soon plan on aquireing the extended versions on the hobbit.</p>
